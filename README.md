The system is ideal for:

- Remote monitoring of electrical assets
- Predictive maintenance and fault logging
- Industrial automation and energy management
- Smart grid and IoT deployments

**Key Benefits:**
- Non-intrusive, safe installation
- Wireless, long-range communication
- Solar-powered, maintenance-free operation
- Real-time data, alerts, and GPS-based event logging
